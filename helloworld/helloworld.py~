# ABOUT
#
#  This implements a new idea for making python scripts (And other scripts) inside XChat.
# Configuration files are generated and put into the respective plugin folder.
# The location of the folder can be called with "command" location.
# 
# Hopefully more scripts will follow suit after this.
#
# CHANGELOG
#
# 0.1
# Released to public.
#
# 0.2
# Cleaned up the readme. Made it easier to understand. (I hope.)
# Changed the checking method so the README can be updated and it will also update the user on load if changed.
# Changed hellofolder to configfolder so that it doesn't have to be changed for other scripts and can just be copied into them instead.
# Added conf.example generation and made it work like the README file so you can update that without harming the original config.

# Import the necessary modules.
